# Pothole Detection using OpenCV and YOLO

This project implements a **pothole detection system** using the **OpenCV library** and the **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm**.  
It is designed to detect potholes in images or video streams, which can be useful for road safety analysis and smart transportation systems.
